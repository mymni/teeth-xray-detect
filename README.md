# teeth-xray-detect
Our U-Net approach utilizes a dataset of 116 panoramic X-ray images with corresponding masks, enabling the training of a model for tooth segmentation.
S brute force image processing approach is also explored, involving techniques such as linear masking, Laplacian filtering, and automatic brightness and contrast adjustment. Jaw area extraction and tooth partitioning techniques are applied, providing insights into the potential of non-machine learning-based methodologies.

The combination of U-Net and image processing methods contributes to a robust and interpretable tooth detection system.

You can run the 2 .ipynb files automatically (Google Colab environment was used to run them - with T4 GPU).
To load the model you can move it to your drive or change the directory.
